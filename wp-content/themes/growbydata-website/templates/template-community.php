                    <p>
                        While we have head offices in Boston and Chicago, the heart of our team is located in Kathmandu. We are engineers, analysts, data scientists, and more who take pride in our work and in our community. We support a long-standing womenâ€™s cooperative, an organization that works with street children from around Nepal, and are building programs to transfer literacy, computer knowledge, and entrepreneurial skills to youth and adults in Kathmandu.

                    <h3>Growing opportunities, cultivating community</h3>
                    <p>
                        At GrowByData, we also firmly believe that one of the most effective ways to support a developing society to lift itself out of poverty is through the creation of local jobs. Through our Catalog Management solution, we are able to take work from our clients around the world, and not only provide low-cost solutions and results, but also direct that work to individuals who might otherwise have limited opportunity to participate in both the local and global economies. Workers, their families, and their communities benefit in turn.

                    <p>
                        On April 25th, 2015, Nepal experienced the first of a series of devastating earthquakes. With help from our global community, GrowByData has been working to help recover and rebuild.
