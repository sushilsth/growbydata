                        <p>
                            As a business leader you don’t have to understand Hadoop or NoSQL databases. Or data visualization. Or predictive analytic models.<br><br>
                            <strong>What you do need to know: this stuff is getting cheaper and more mainstream every day. It's going to change the world.</strong><br><br>
                            Just as the revolution in computing enabled new companies &mdash; like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google &mdash; to become global powerhouses, the data revolution will create opportunities for a new class of companies to emerge, from niche leaders to global leaders.
